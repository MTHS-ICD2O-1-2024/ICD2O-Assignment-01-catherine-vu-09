              <div style="text-align: left;">Donald Knuth full name is Donald Ervin Knuth and he was born on January 10, 1938. Donald was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is an only child. He is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He demonstrated his problem solving skills at school. In middle school, he won a word contest by identifying over 4,500
              words from "Ziegler's Giant Bar, “ which made them win a whole television and candy bars for everyone.

                      <div style="text-align: left;">In 1956, he had a scholarship to Case Institute of Technology in 1956, taking his first interest into computing. During
                      his scholarship, he already had quite a few accomplishments, by rewriting IBM 650's code. 2 years later, creating a
                      program to observe basketball player performance, he helped assemble Case's Engineering and Science Review, winning a
                      national award a year later. Then switching his course, mathematics, earned both a bachelor's and master's degree
                      another year after. He wrote an ALGOL compiler for Burroughs Corporation. Finally, earning his PhD in mathematics from
                      Caltech in 1963.

                      <div style="text-align: left;">In 1967, he created the term Analysis of Algorithms at a SIAM conference. Then working at Princeton, he joined Stanford in 1969, becoming a professor because of cryptographic research. A few decades later, he earned emeritus status in 1993.

<div style="text-align: left;">He is creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, Metafont, a descriptive language made up of raster fonts. and the Computer Modern family of typeface. Donald is the author of the multi-volume work
The Art of Computer Programming.He is the “ father “ of analysis of algorithms. He helped grow the development to ensure everything is correct and
completed but observing carefully and logically in resources, such as time and memory, used to the algorithms to run it
of computational complexity. There is something called input (n) and it relies on complexity, input n can also be shown
as f(n). Time can be used to count on the amount of operations used while Space is the amount of memory needed for the
algorithms and organizing into groups that are connected and work well together or to a specific plan. They are
organized based on worst-case scenario complexity and best-case scenario complexity. In the worst-case scenario, The
longest time or most memory an algorithm will ever need for any input. While the best-case scenario is the expected time
or memory used on typical inputs.
